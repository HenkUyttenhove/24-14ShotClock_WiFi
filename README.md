# Basketball 24/14 seconds display and controller on ESP32

## This project is replacing the original project with LORA
When I started the orginal project in 2017, multi-threading on MicroPython and Pycom devices was not a thing.
As a result, I had a lot of issues to have a stable connection between controller and display using WiFi.

With the support of multi-threading in MicroPython, this has changed and this project is now using standard WiFi instead of LORA.
